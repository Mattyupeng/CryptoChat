You are improving the Hushline prototype — a wallet-native, privacy-first messaging platform for Web3. The current version includes:

- Wallet login (Solana wallet connect)
- Encrypted 1:1 chat interface
- Working MiniApp launcher (slide-down)
- Embedded MiniApps (via iframe) like Jupiter, Mints.live

Now we need to polish the experience and prepare for next-phase features. Focus on improving **usability, visual consistency, and extensibility** for MiniApps, bots, and social metadata.

---

✅ Maintain:
- Clean, wallet-only login  
- End-to-end encrypted chat as foundation  
- Working MiniApp launcher (don’t remove)  
- Wallet-to-wallet identity UX  

---

🎯 Improvements to Focus On:

1. **UI/UX Polishing**
   - Refine chat bubble styles: left/right alignment, distinguish sender/recipient colors  
   - Add ENS/wallet preview on hover or inside message meta  
   - Improve spacing: more consistent padding (`px-4 py-3`), line height, font weight (`text-base font-medium`)

2. **MiniApp Tray Enhancements**
   - Add labels/descriptions for each MiniApp (not just icons)  
   - Support scrollable categories: “Trending,” “Tools,” “Bots”  
   - Add pin/favorite button to save most-used apps  
   - Show loading states or fallback message if iframe fails

3. **Input Area Refinement**
   - Add emoji button and `/` command system for Copilot, bots, future features  
   - Show placeholder text like “Type a message or /command…”  
   - Add send icon with hover animation

4. **Header Bar & Navigation**
   - Add top bar showing chat title (ENS or address), with avatar preview  
   - Include quick buttons: Settings, MiniApp toggle, “My Reputation” (placeholder for social metadata)

5. **Performance & Accessibility**
   - Improve mobile responsiveness: check layout wrap, safe input area  
   - Add transitions for MiniApp open/close  
   - Ensure iframe sandboxing is consistent and secure

🛠️ Optional Next Steps:
- Add mock “Bot message card” (e.g. Copilot response or airdrop link)
- Create an early **"Reputation Score" panel** that updates with # of messages
- Prep a structure for **MiniApp reviews/ratings** to support ecosystem expansion

Please improve and modularize the UI to prepare for onboarding groups, bots, and early campaigns.
